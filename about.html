        <h1>Bio</h1>

        <p>Elena Segen Mejia comes to Walla Walla from Portland, Oregon, bringing over 20 years experience in the healing profession. In addition to being a licensed acupuncturist and herbalist, she is a family nurse practitioner and certified lactation consult. Her experience includes working with people from the full life spectrum, including the tiniest of newborns to the very wise. She helps her patients by combining a unique understanding of both Eastern and Western healthcare. When appropriate, she readily collaborates with other medical professionals to provide the best treatment possible. She is trained in a variety of conditions including chronic illness, digestive issues, sports injuries, gynecology, postpartum, breast feeding and much more. However, whether she is treating a new or long standing condition, Elena's complimentary approach focuses on each individual's symptoms and needs. In her work, Elena combines the knowledge that individuals have of their conditions with holistic clinical expertise and guidance. She believes that healing begins when we include ourselves in our journey to a state of wellness. Her overall goal is to support her clients in this process to achieve and maintain optimum health and vitality. Because of her gentle and open manner, children and teens find her approach particularly comforting. </p>

        <p>Elena began her career in 1991 when she graduated from Yale University with a Master's in Nursing. She is a nationally certified family nurse practitioner though the ANCC. Since 1993, she has been living and working in Oregon. Because of her love of acupuncture and herbal medicine, she was inspired to return to school. In 2011 she received her Master's in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine from the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine. She is nationally certified and holds diplomate status with NCCAOM. Most recently she was awarded her International Board Certified Lactation Consult (IBCLC). Her undergraduate degree is in physiology from the University of California Berkeley. </p>
        <p>
            In February 2014 she began working at Advance Health Clinic in downtown Walla Walla with Daniel Bruner, acupuncturist and owner of the clinic, and Jan Atwater, massage therapist. In addition, she works part-time at the Walla Walla VA Medical Center.
        </p>

        <p>
            When not at work, Elena can be found in the kitchen cooking up her latest concoction, enjoying the outdoors, doing yoga or qigong, as well as spending time with her partner, two children, ages 14 and 17, and their Great Dane.
